# CustomPhysicsController
Writing a character controller without custom physics

The code for gravity, collisions, slope climbing, jumping, and various edge cases are written by applying Newton's Laws of motion, Kinematics, Trigonometry and more.
The movement can be applied using a Transform or Kinematic RigidBody

There is also a Dynamic RigidBody with addition configurations for slopes in the project
